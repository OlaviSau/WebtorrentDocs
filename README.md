# WebtorrentDocs
Hello, welcome to my humble documentation page :)


You can find some descriptions for feross's webtorrent project,but you should be careful as to use this repo as a definite source of documentation for his project. It's more for me to understand his project indepth.

#### On style
I have tried to use the style on MDN for familiarity

#### On updates
I'll try to add some documentation every day, perhaps I'll write a small guide, but this is unlikely since my time resources will be limited in the near future.
